# [McKay's Movies](https://mckay-flix.web.app)
## Initial Concept
Users can access a comprehensive list of movies and TV series owned by McKay on this website. The collection comprises titles that have been accumulated over time and can be found on both VUDU and Apple TV. In addition, the website offers a sign-up and sign-in feature that enables users to create a personalized watchlist for movies they wish to view in the future.

## Usage
Anyone can access the website via the url: https://mckay-flix.web.app

The homepage features a prominent movie as the main highlight, along with an option to view more. Multiple rows of movies organized by series and genres are displayed below, providing quick access. The navigation bar includes an "All Movies" link that redirects users to a page showcasing all movies. Here, users can search for a specific movie or apply filters to narrow down their search.

Users can also sign up to keep track of the movies they plan to watch later. Once signed in, they can click on the clock icon to add the movie to their watchlist. Clicking on an individual movie takes users to its dedicated page, which displays relevant information such as a "Watch Later" button, VUDU and Apple TV links to access the movie, an IMDb link for more information, release date, runtime in minutes, and a brief synopsis.
